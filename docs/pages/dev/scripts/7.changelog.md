# ðŸ“Œ changelog.sh

This script automates the generation and updating of a `CHANGELOG.md` file using release information fetched from GitHub. It facilitates updating the changelog based on the latest release, and optionally commits and pushes the changes to the Git repository if specified.

## Operations

- **Load base script**: Sources the `base.sh` script from the `scripts` directory to leverage utility functions.
- **Load environment variables**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file if it exists in the project root, which may override default values.
- **GitHub CLI check**: Ensures that the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is installed and authenticated; if not, it prompts the user to log in.
- **Variables Setup**: `CHANGELOG_FILE_PATH` specifies the path of the changelog file, defaulting to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Input Parsing**:
    - **Flags**:
        - `-c` or `--commit`: Indicates whether to commit the changelog updates.
        - `-p` or `--push`: Indicates whether to push the changelog updates after committing.
- **Changelog Update**:
    - **Release Tag and Notes**: Fetches the latest release tag and release notes using `gh release view`.
    - **File Update**: Adds or updates the changelog header, appending a new section for the latest release with its tag, release date, and notes.
    - **File Commit and Push** (optional):
        - Commits the changelog updates to the Git repository if `-c` is provided.
        - Pushes the changes if `-p` is also provided.

# üè† base.sh

This is a base script used to define common utility functions for other scripts in the project.

It contains the following key features:

- **Date format definition**: Defines a date format that is used throughout the scripts.
- **Colour codes**: Sets up color codes for console logging if the terminal is recognized as an xterm.
- **Logging functions**: Includes `echoError`, `echoWarn`, `echoInfo`, and `echoOk` which log messages to the console with a timestamp, color-coded based on their severity (error, warning, information, success respectively).
- **Existence checks**: Implements the `exitIfNotExists` and `exitIfNoGit` functions which check for the existence of a file and the Git software, respectively. They log an error and terminate the script with an appropriate exit code if the check fails.
